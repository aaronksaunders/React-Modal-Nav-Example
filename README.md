# React-Modal-Nav-Example 

Sample application showing how get the standard IOS modal dialog experience with React-Native. 

I did see an example in the UIExplorer Application, but it seemed like alot of code for a pretty basic feature, setting up the seperate routing object and without additional documentation, the [Kureev/react-native-navbar](https://github.com/Kureev/react-native-navbar) module met my needs
